# Blood Donation Tracker - Abstract

The Blood Donation Tracker is a comprehensive full-stack web application designed to address critical blood shortage challenges in healthcare by creating an efficient digital ecosystem connecting blood donors, patients, and healthcare facilities. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), the platform features a role-based authentication system supporting Donors, Patients, and Admins, with secure JWT token-based authentication and bcrypt password encryption. The application provides real-time blood availability search functionality across all blood groups (A+, A-, B+, B-, AB+, AB-, O+, O-), an intelligent blood request system that notifies matching donors when specific blood types are unavailable, and a comprehensive scheduling system for coordinating donation appointments with urgency level indicators. Additional features include a blood center directory with location-based search, voluntary blood donation camp registration and management, educational resources about blood donation processes and eligibility criteria, and an AI-powered chatbot for 24/7 user support. The frontend is developed using React.js 18.2.0 with Tailwind CSS for responsive design and Socket.io-client for real-time communication, while the backend utilizes Node.js with Express.js, MongoDB with Mongoose ODM, and implements WebSocket connections for live updates. The application is deployed on cloud platforms (Netlify/Vercel for frontend, Railway/Render for backend, and MongoDB Atlas for database) ensuring scalability and high availability. By streamlining the blood donation process, reducing emergency response times, and promoting awareness through accessible technology, this platform has the potential to save lives by efficiently connecting those in need with willing donors, ultimately contributing to solving blood shortage crises and improving healthcare accessibility in emergency situations.
